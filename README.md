# üè¶ Bank Loan Analysis | SQL + Power BI End-to-End Project

A comprehensive **Finance Domain Project** built using **SQL Server** and **Power BI Desktop**, performing both **data analytics and business intelligence reporting**.  
This project transforms raw financial loan data into actionable insights that help banks assess portfolio performance, borrower credit behavior, and funding efficiency.

---

## üìò Project Overview

**Objective:**  
To analyze loan applications, funding rates, repayment behavior, and portfolio performance using advanced data modeling and visualization.

**Goals:**
- Evaluate total loan disbursements and repayments.
- Identify good vs bad loans to measure collection health.
- Track KPIs like *Average DTI, Average Interest Rate,* and *MoM Funding Growth.*
- Enable business users to filter and view data across multiple dimensions (State, Grade, Purpose, Tenure).

**Deliverables:**
- Cleaned and structured SQL database (`Bank_Loan_DB`)
- Data views and performance metrics created using SQL queries
- Interactive Power BI dashboard with navigation and dynamic KPIs

---

## üß† Domain Context

In the banking industry, understanding borrower risk and repayment trends is essential.  
Through this analysis, the project uncovers **insightful financial metrics** that aid in decision-making, such as:

- **Loan Origination Trends** (month-on-month analysis)
- **Customer Repayment Patterns**
- **Default Ratios and Portfolio Distribution**
- **State and Term-Wise Lending Performance**

## üß© Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ SQL Development Process
CREATE DATABASE Bank_Loan;
USE Bank_Loan;

-- Created loans_data table
-- Imported raw CSV data via SQL import utility
-- Cleaned and standardized date formats and numeric types


### Data Preparation:
- Removed nulls & handled missing Employee Titles
- Verified datatypes (`DECIMAL` for Amounts, `DATE` for Date fields)
- Established primary key (`id`)

### Analytical SQL Views
Examples of SQL Analytical Views created:

| Metric | SQL View Name | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Total Loan Applications | `Total_Loan_Applications` | Monthly trend of loan applications |
| Funded Amounts | `Total_Funded_Amount` | Month-wise total funding issued |
| Total Repayment | `Total_Amount_Received` | Outgoing vs repaid amount summary |
| Average Interest Rate | `Average_Interest_Rate` | Tracks lending interest trends |
| DTI Ratio | `Average_DTI_Ratio` | Debt-to-income ratio across borrowers |
| Loan Health | `Good_Loan_Applications` / `Bad_Loan_Applications` | Classifies performing vs non-performing loans |

#### Additional SQL Analytical Layers:
- Regional Analysis by State  
- Loan Purpose Breakdown (credit card, education, home improvement, etc.)  
- Loan Term & Employee Length Analysis

## üí° Power BI Dashboard Development

After building analytical SQL views, data was imported and modeled in Power BI.

### Data Modeling:
- Established 1:* relationship between `Date Table` and `Loans Data`
- Ensured single-direction filtering for accuracy  
- Built a structured model that supports DAX calculations like:
  - `[MTD Funded Amount]`
  - `[MoM Loan Applications]`
  - `[Good Loan %]` and `[Bad Loan %]`

### Dashboard Pages:

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Summary Dashboard**
- KPIs: Total Loans, Funded Amount, Receipts, Avg Interest, Avg DTI  
- Metrics: MTD vs MoM Growth Indicators  
- Donut chart showing Good Loans (repaying on time) vs Bad Loans (charged off)

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Overview Dashboard**
- Dynamic metric switching using Field Parameters  
- Charts: Issue Date Trends, Regional Analysis, Loan Purpose Breakdown  
- Insights: Month and state-wise performance comparison

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Detailed Data View**
- Tabular report of loans at customer level  
- Filters for state, purpose, grade, and loan term  
- Easily exportable for management reporting
